*Create a function that can subtract two lists of courses (academic record from program).
*Implement winter/summer mechanic for sequence generation. 
*Implement corequisites (there is a prototype in functionsForFutureUse.php). 
*Implement orrequisites. 
*re-organize files
*Make printSeq output a JSON file instead of just echos
*take input from front end: courseLoad and desired courses
*implement desired courses function
*My assignLevel functions overwrite the prerequisites of each course in order the update them because I didnt bother passing by value.
